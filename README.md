# 🚀 Striver A2Z DSA Sheet – Complete Solutions 💻❤️

Welcome to my journey through the legendary **Striver A2Z DSA Sheet**!  
This repo is my personal notebook of code, struggle, late-night debugging, and *tiny victories* — all in the name of mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms**.

## 🌟 About the Sheet

The [Striver A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2-0/) is one of the most comprehensive DSA roadmaps out there — carefully crafted by **Striver (Raj Vikramaditya)** to guide you from absolute basics to advanced problem-solving.

Whether you're preparing for **placements**, **internships**, or just want to build your fundamentals like a boss, this sheet is a total game-changer.

## 📁 Structure of this Repository

This repo contains:

- ✅ **Clean code** for every question in the sheet.
- 🧠 **Problem links** (mostly from Leetcode, GFG, or CodeStudio).
- 📌 **My insights & observations** when something tricky shows up.

Each section of the sheet (Basics, Arrays, Sorting, Recursion, DP, Trees, Graphs, and more) has its code and built with 💙.

## 📅 Current Progress

> This journey is ongoing. I’m committed to consistency.  
> Some days are easy, some days are brutal — but every line of code is a step closer to cracking it.

Keep an eye on this space — updates coming in regularly! 🛠️

## 🧑‍💻 Why I'm Doing This

Honestly?  
- To **build real DSA muscle.**
- To stay **accountable and consistent.**
- To **help others** walking the same path.
- And yeah… maybe crack a few FAANG dreams on the way ✨
